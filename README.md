This repository is a learning and experimentation project based on the paper “Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks” by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych.
The goal of this project is to understand the basic functioning of Sentence BERT, and to see how well they perform on cross domain generalisation, using small scale experiments. 

The core objective is to see how well a SBERT model trained on a specific domain performs in another completely unrelated and unseen domain. 

This setup deduces whether a SBERT model learns through general semantic understanding, or if it becomes generalised to a specialised domain.
